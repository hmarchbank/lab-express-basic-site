        <h3>United States</h3>
        <p>The highest honor a casting director can receive in the United States is the Artios Award, awarded by their peers
            in the Casting Society of America. Artios comes from the Greek word meaning "perfectly fitted." The Artios award
            excellence in casting for all genres of casting except commercials. The Artios are currently held mid-January
            annually with ceremonies in New York, Los Angeles, and (beginning in 2018) London. Since their incarnation in
            1985, they were held in November but were moved in the 2013â€“2014 season to align with the rest of the film and
            television industry's awards season. The Artios is awarded to those CSA members who receive primary screen (or
            program) credit for casting on the winning project. Location Casting Directors, Casting Executives and
            Department Heads who are CSA members and who receive credit on winning projects also receive an Artios Award.
            CSA Associates on those projects are recognized in the press and with a certificate. The Emmy Awards has a
            category for casting directors. As of 2017, Junie Lowry-Johnson has won the most casting Emmys as an individual,
            all in the drama category. She has six awards for her work on NYPD Blue, Six Feet Under, True Blood and
            Homeland. The only shows to win casting Emmys three times were 30 Rock and Veep, both in the comedy category. In
            2017, at the 69th Primetime Emmy Awards, the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences introduced the Primetime Emmy
            Award for Outstanding Casting for a Reality Program.</p>
