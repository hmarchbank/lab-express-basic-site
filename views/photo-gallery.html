                    perceptive and good with problem solving skills, Light is a skilled planner and good at mapping out
                    scenarios. Furthermore, Light is very popular among peers and adored by his family members. However,
                    his high intelligence and constant praise from adults laid the foundation for an intense level of
                    hubris which quickly took effect once he obtained the notebook.</p>

                    letter L drawn in "Old English MT" or "Cloister Black" typeface. It is more likely to be "Cloister
                    Black" as Watari's "W" is different in "Old English MT."</p>

                    otherwise childlike, evidenced by her tendency to speak in the third person. Despite being
                    considered idiotic by many, Misa is shown to have moments of intelligence, such as when she
                    successfully tricks Kyosuke Higuchi into revealing himself to be the Yotsuba Kira.</p>

                    Kiraâ€™s Kingdom question that asked what he thought of Kira was simply "God." His loyalty to Kira is
                    exemplified when he forces himself to stop questioning Kira after he is perplexed by the task of
                    creating and using a fake notebook. Aside from his disdain of "lazy people", Mikami shares the same
                    view on crime as Kira, which is what made Light choose him to carry out judgments when he was put
                    under surveillance.</p>
