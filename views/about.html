                        Death Note is a Japanese manga series written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated by Takeshi Obata. 
                        The story follows Light Yagami, a teen genius who discovers a mysterious notebook: the "Death Note", which 
                        belonged to the Shinigami Ryuk, and grants the user the supernatural ability to kill anyone whose name is 
                        written in its pages. The series centers around Light's subsequent attempts to use the Death Note to carry 
                        out a worldwide massacre of individuals whom he deems immoral and to create a crime-free society, using the 
                        alias of a god-like vigilante named "Kira", and the subsequent efforts of an elite Japanese police task force,
                        led by enigmatic detective L, to apprehend him. Death Note ran in Shueisha's manga magazine Weekly 
                        Shōnen Jump from December 2003 to May 2006. Its 108 chapters were collected in 12 tankōbon volumes.
